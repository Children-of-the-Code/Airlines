my controller class is for managing my web endpoints
the reason it's called a 'controller' is because if we were to program it manually,
it would be something like a massive switching station for which we divert incoming http requests
to their proper handlers

we should define what our goals for how we should interact with the web

i want to get all flight information
i want to get a single flight information
i want to get all airlines

i want to post a flight

i want to update a flight

think of endpoints in the context of a real website -
what are the total amount of endpoints needed to make a website function?
for instance, facebook
at minimum -

post a new account
get some security get using login info
post a friend request
get all friend requests
get a user's profile
get messages
post a message
get likes
post like
update profile
