for the present, i'm going to ignore having a DAO layer,
even though in a real application, we will have a DAO layer that is intended to manage persistence,
(java memory is cleared when the program stops running)
for the present moment, the project requirements to not contain DAO layer,
we don't intending persistence at the moment anyways

what service methods do i need?
ultimately, i need everything that is required by my controllers
