My model:
a model of the real-world things that we're trying to represent
In your case, you're trying to represent users and reimbursements
In my case, I want to represent airlines and flights

We need a couple things:
our fields - the variables in an object that store its respective information
flight - (airline ID, flight ID, plane type, destination, departing city, status (this will also be an enum))
airline - airline name, airline ID
